As part of the effort to communicate better what’s going on within the PHP-FIG we’re starting a new series of ‘A month of PHP-FIG’ articles to be released towards the end of each month, each being a 2 minute read or less.


This month has been a busy month for the PHP-FIG. We’ve kickstarted a couple of PSRs with PSR-12¹ being formally re-introduced into the draft stage; internally we’ve started the voting for the secretary elections for two secretary posts; and lots of ideas have been flowing to try and get a number of PSRs moving again.
