And we’re back with another update on what’s going on in the PHP-FIG! This time we have just two news, but big ones!

PSR-14 has been approved
Since the last update, we’ve seen the approval of PSR-14, the Event Dispatcher standard. This new PSR allows packages to rely on a generic interface to dispatch events, without having to write framework-specific code to hook into them.


The PSR-14 page on our site
Apart from reading the spec, you can delve deeper following a fantastic blog series published by the spec’s editor, Larry Garfield:

A major event in PHP
All about Events
Being a good Provider
Advanced Providers
Compound Providers
Example — Access voting
Example — Plugin registration
Example — Delayed Events, Queues, and Asynchronicity
Example — PSR-14 in a non-blocking application server
Example — layered caching
The May elections
During May we held a new cycle of elections, as per our bylaws. As in every election there were four Core Committee seats and one Secretary position up for election, plus one additional Core Committee seat due to Lukas Kahwe Smith stepping down early.

At the end of the election, the final result is that we have Asmir Mustafic (@goetas_asmir) as a new secretary, Woody Gilk (@shadowhand) and Matteo Beccati (@mbeccati) as new CC members, and three renewed CC positions (Beau Simensen (@beausimensen), Larry Garfield (@Crell) and Matthew Weier O’Phinney (@mwop)). Congratulations to all of them!

I would also take the occasion to thank the three stepping down members, Margret Staples (@dead_lugosi), Sara Golemon (@SaraMG) and Lukas Kahwe Smith (@lsmith): thank you for all your contributions during these years!
